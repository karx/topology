# Topology

## Why this ?
Call this my new found love for github pages, call it my interest in Mathematics, call it hobby if you want.
It is.
Well, it is very difficult to convince people to learn something new. And Feynman said that teach to learn best. So I figured I could do this, with virtual people.


## What to expect?
I would attempt to go over __Topology__.

Books used:
* Topology by Munkres [link](https://amzn.to/2DDoVnY)

This would include:
* Theories and proofs
* Working of examples
* Solving few exercises
* End project. Would use this for a project framework: [project-instructions](www.math.harvard.edu/~sebv/101-fall-2018/project-instructions.pdf)
